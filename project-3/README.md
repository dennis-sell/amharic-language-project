Methodology: It was extremely difficult to find online sources. There are copious amounts of resources in print which contain interlinear glosses, but it is difficult to scrape them. Even getting the glosses out of this book proved to be very challenging. In order to get the characters, I used an Optical Character recognition system provided at http://ocr.ethiocloud.com/ .
However, this was not ideal for three large reasons. First, OCR is inherently noisy. It is especially noisy for Amharic due to the nature of the alphabet. The scans are often not high quality, so it is difficult for the system to differentiate between similar characters. There were two major errors I saw. The system was often unable to see the small inflections on characters. For example, ል would be read as ለ. These types of character differences are integral to the Amharic alphabet, which contributes to the difficulty of a high quality OCR system. the other common mistake was between similar characters such as ሥ and ማ. The "tops" would get cut off of the latter. This applies to all morphologies of these characters. These are the two that were obvious to a non speaker of Amharic, so there were many other errors that I may not have seen. I verified each sentence myself after the OCR and attempted to correct it, but it is certainly necessary to have some understanding of the alphabet to be able to see the nuances. It would be an interesting exercise to crowdsource this type of correction for native Amharic speakers.  
The second main issue was that this OCR system could not read mixed English and Amharic. This greatly limited the speed of scraping. I had to individually crop images to only get the Amharic and feed it into the OCR system: if you had any English in it, the system would crash. If this were availble, it would be far more feasible to scrape entire dictionaries and language books at once. 
The third issue was that this system limited you to 5 queries per day. Obviously, this created issues. 

It is good to note that there has been some reasearch into Amharic OCR. A paper published in 2007 by Million Meshesha and C.V. Jawahar [1] outlines work they have put into building a better system. They were able to achieve high accuracy (~90%) for their test sets, which seems to be better than what I got from this free system.  

If there was a good OCR system such as this, it would be far easier to extract data such as this from the various sources available.
